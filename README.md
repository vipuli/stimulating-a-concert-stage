# stimulating-a-concert-stage (2D Simulation)

A Python-based concert stage simulation.

This project simulates a concert for the rock band *Spinal Tap*, showcasing stage lighting, smoke, props, and audience elements. The simulation produces dynamic graphical outputs using **Matplotlib**.

---

## Features

- **Lights:** Multiple colored lights with intensity control and beams.
- **Smoke Machine:** Simulated smoke diffusion using random movement.
- **Props/Band:** Stage props and band members represented with geometric shapes.
- **Backdrop:** Customizable image backdrop (`StageLight.jpg`).
- **Choreography:** Optionally read `choreography.csv` to control lighting and smoke per frame.

## How to Run

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+  
- Libraries: `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `random`

### Run the simulation
